# 🎉 New Features Added to RAG Playground

## ✨ What's New

### 1. **Performance Dashboard** 📊
**Location**: Appears below the Demo Panel for each architecture

**Features**:
- Real-time performance metrics visualization
- Key metrics: Latency, Cost, Accuracy, Scalability
- Beautiful animated progress bars
- Performance summary with badges
- Color-coded metrics (blue for speed, green for cost, purple for accuracy)

**Educational Value**: Users can see at a glance how each architecture performs across different dimensions, making it easier to choose the right one for their use case.

### 2. **Learning Progress Tracker** 🏆
**Location**: Left sidebar in the Playground

**Features**:
- Tracks which architectures you've explored
- Progress percentage visualization
- Achievement badges (First Steps, Explorer, Master Explorer, RAG Master)
- "Next Up" recommendations
- Architecture checklist with completion status
- Persistent storage (localStorage)

**Educational Value**: Gamification increases engagement and helps users track their learning journey. The "Next Up" feature guides users through a logical learning path.

**How it works**:
- Automatically tracks when you view an architecture
- Shows progress as you explore more architectures
- Unlocks achievements as you progress
- Suggests the next architecture to learn

### 3. **Side-by-Side Testing** 🧪
**Location**: "Test Side-by-Side" button in the Playground header

**Features**:
- Test the same query across 2-4 architectures simultaneously
- Real-time comparison of results
- Highlights best accuracy and fastest response
- Side-by-side results display
- Performance metrics comparison
- Visual indicators for winners (best accuracy, fastest)

**Educational Value**: Users can directly compare how different architectures handle the same query, seeing differences in accuracy, speed, and document retrieval.

**How to use**:
1. Click "Test Side-by-Side" button
2. Select 2-4 architectures to compare
3. Enter a query
4. See results side-by-side with performance metrics
